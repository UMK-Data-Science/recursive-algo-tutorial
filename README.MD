# Instructions
This tutorial consists with 6 questions. Try to complete this tutorial by commit your changes and read the question carefully :smile: 

# Exercise 1
Write C program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using recursion

```
Expected Output: 
The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is 55
```

# Exercise 2
Write C program to print Fibonacci Series using recursion where the input number of series is N = 10

```
Expected Output: 
The Series are: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
```

# Exercise 3
Write C program to find the Factorial of a number using recursion where the test data, N = 5

```
Expected Output: 
The Factorial of 5 is 120
```

# Exercise 4
Write C program to count the digits of a given number using recursion

```
Test Data
Input a number: 50
```

```
Expected Output:
The number of digits in the number is 2
```

# Exercise 5
Write a C program to find the sum of digits of a number using recursion function

```
Test Data
Input any number to find sum of digits: 25
```

```
Expected Output: 
The sum of digits of 25 is 7
```
